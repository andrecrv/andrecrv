# Hi there! 👋

I’m a **Junior Developer** with a strong passion for building and learning. With a solid foundation in **full-stack development** (Java & JavaScript), I’m constantly exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to refine my skills.

At present, I’m focusing on **React.js** for frontend development and experimenting with **React Native** for mobile applications. I enjoy solving problems, overcoming challenges, and continuously developing myself as a developer. I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and the potential to collaborate, create, and contribute to meaningful projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I’m working on. I’m always open to new ideas, feedback, and connections!
